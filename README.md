# iOS-Table-View-Demonstrator
This project was written in Swift for CS470 - Advanced Software Design. 
Boiler-plate Code was developed by Ali Kooshesh - Head of CS @ SSU.

This project downloads JSON based on Tracks, Artists, Albums, and Images of a specific Artist.
Then, a table view is used to Display each artist. 
The user is able to tap a specific Cell, view that artist's albums, and then view tracks within a specific album.
